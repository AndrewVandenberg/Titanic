# Titanic Kaggle Project

## 1. Importing data

I imported the Titanic data set from Kaggle using the pandas library.

## 2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

I used the `describe()` and `info()` methods, as well as functions from seaborn, to glimpse over the data to get an idea of it.

## 3. Splitting up the data

I split up the data, and used the survived feature as the target/y variable, and the rest of the features as the X/training vaiables.

## 4. Training and testing the data

I trained the data through the `train_test_split` method and used a linear regression model to test the data.

## 5. Analysis and Results

My final results from the model
